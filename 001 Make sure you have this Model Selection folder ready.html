<p>Hello my friends!</p><p>Now we are finally going to get an answer to that ultimate question: How do I know which classification model to choose for a particular problem/dataset?</p><p>Well we are all going to answer this question together and to do this, I've prepared for you a folder containing all the classification code templates, and a generic real-world dataset which we will use to answer that question above. Here is the link to the whole Model Selection folder, which we will start from in the next tutorial:</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O8vabaxga3ITjCWfwD79Xnyf8RavYuyk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O8vabaxga3ITjCWfwD79Xnyf8RavYuyk</a></p><p>Also, please download the same folder attached in a zip file at the bottom of this article, in order to get these codes and the dataset on your machine.</p><p>Looking forward to showing you the powerful classification code templates in action!</p><p>Hadelin</p>
