<p>Welcome to Part 1 on Data Preprocessing!</p><p>We will start by learning and doing Data Preprocessing in Python (next section), and then in R (section after Python). I remind that it is not necessary to master the two languages.&nbsp;We just made this course in both Python and R so that everyone can work on its favourite programming language.</p><p>So feel free to pick the section you want (Python or R), and then move on to Part 2 - Regression.</p><p>Excited to begin with you the Machine Learning journey!</p><p>Hadelin</p>
