<p>Welcome to Part 10- Model Selection &amp; Boosting!</p>

<p><br></p>





<p>After we built our Machine Learning models, some questions remained unanswered:</p>



<ol><li>How to deal with the bias variance tradeoff when building a model and evaluating its performance ?</li><li>How to choose the optimal values for the hyperparameters (the parameters that are not learned) ?</li><li>How to find the most appropriateMachine Learning model for my business problem?</li></ol>



<p>In this part we will answer these questions thanks to Model Selection techniques including:</p>



<ol><li>k-Fold Cross Validation</li><li>Grid Search</li></ol>



<p>Eventually we will finish this course by a last bonus section included in this part, dedicated to one of the most powerful Machine Learning model, that has become more and more popular: XGBoost.</p>

<p>Enjoy Machine Learning!</p>
