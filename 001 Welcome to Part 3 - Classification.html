<p>Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use&nbsp;classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.</p>









<p>In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Classification models:</p>
