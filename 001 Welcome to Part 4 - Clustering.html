<p>Welcome to Part 4&nbsp;- Clustering!</p>

<p>Clustering is similar to classification, but the basis is different. In&nbsp;Clustering you dont know what you are looking for, and you are trying to identify some segments or&nbsp;clusters in your data. When you use clustering algorithms on your dataset, unexpected things can suddenly pop up&nbsp;like structures, clusters and groupings you&nbsp;would have never thought of otherwise.</p>









<p>In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Clustering models:</p>
