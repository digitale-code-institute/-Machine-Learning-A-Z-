<p>Hello students,</p><p>For those of you interested in following the Python tutorials of this course, here&nbsp;is a short summary of what you need to know in Object-oriented programming. In the Python tutorials, I will be talking about classes,&nbsp;objects and methods. Please find below a clear explanation of what these concepts are:</p><p>A class is the model, or a blueprint, of something we want to build. For example, if we make a house&nbsp;construction plan that gathers the instructions on&nbsp;how to build a&nbsp;house, then this&nbsp;construction plan is the class.</p><p>An object is an instance of the class. So if we take that same example of the house construction plan, then an object is simply a house. A house (the object)&nbsp;that was built by following the instructions of the&nbsp;construction plan (the class).<br>And therefore&nbsp;there can be many objects of the same class, because we can build many houses from the&nbsp;construction plan.</p><p>A method is a tool we can use on the object to complete a specific action. So in this&nbsp;same example, a tool can be to open the main door of the house if a guest is coming. A method can also be seen as a function that is applied onto the object, takes some inputs (that were defined in the class) and returns some output.</p><p>Hope this&nbsp;helps you get the intuition of&nbsp;Object-oriented programming, don't hesitate to ask for more explanations in the Q&amp;A if anything is unclear.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Hadelin and Kirill</p><p><br></p>
