<p>Hello students,</p><p>Congratulations for having completed Part 7 - Natural Language Processing.</p><p>If you are up for some&nbsp;practical activities, here is a little challenge:</p><p>1. Run the other classification models we made in Part 3 - Classification, other than the one we used in the last tutorial.</p><p>2. Evaluate the performance of each of these models. Try to beat the Accuracy obtained in the tutorial. But remember,&nbsp;Accuracy is not enough, so you should also look at other performance metrics like Precision (measuring exactness), Recall (measuring&nbsp;completeness)&nbsp;and the F1 Score (compromise between Precision and Recall). Please find below these metrics formulas&nbsp;(TP = # True Positives, TN = # True Negatives, FP = # False Positives, FN = # False Negatives):</p><p>Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)</p><p>Precision = TP / (TP + FP)</p><p>Recall = TP / (TP + FN)</p><p>F1 Score = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)</p><p>3. Try even other&nbsp;classification models that we haven't covered in Part 3 - Classification. Good ones for NLP include:</p><ul><li><p>CART</p></li><li><p>C5.0</p></li><li><p>Maximum Entropy</p></li></ul><p>Submit your results in the Q&amp;A for this Lecture or by pm and justify in few words why you think it's the most appropriate&nbsp;model.</p><p>Enjoy Machine Learning!</p><p>Best to all,</p><p>Hadelin</p>
